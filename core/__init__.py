# NOTE: GameOrchestrator/VendorPoller/VendorSession are deliberately NOT
# re-exported here. core.vendor imports from ..items, and items.py imports
# several core submodules — eagerly loading core.vendor (or game_orchestrator,
# which imports it) from this package __init__ creates a circular import
# whenever items.py/world.py import anything from core first. Import those
# two directly from their submodules (core.game_orchestrator / core.vendor).
